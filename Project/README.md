# Linear Control Systems Project

This repository contains the project for the **Linear Control Systems** course. The project covers key concepts such as Bode plots, Nyquist diagrams, and controller design.

## Project Overview  
The project consists of the following seven sections:

1. **System Modeling** - Defining the transfer function and system characteristics.  
2. **Time Response Analysis** - Evaluating system response to step and impulse inputs.  
3. **Root Locus Analysis** - Analyzing system stability and pole-zero placements.  
4. **Bode Plot Analysis** - Plotting magnitude and phase response to assess frequency behavior.  
5. **Nyquist Plot Analysis** - Evaluating system stability using Nyquist criteria.  
6. **Controller Design** - Implementing PID and lead-lag compensators for performance improvement.  
7. **Final Evaluation** - Verifying the system's performance under designed control strategies.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (for numerical analysis and plotting)  
- **MATLAB** (for control system analysis and simulation)  
- **LaTeX** (for documentation and report preparation)
