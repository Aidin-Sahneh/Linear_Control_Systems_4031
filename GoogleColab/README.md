# Google Colab Notebooks - Linear Control Systems

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks developed in **Google Colab** for analyzing and simulating **Linear Control Systems**. These notebooks include various control system concepts, simulations, and stability analyses.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Bode Plot Analysis (`bode_plot.ipynb`)** - Generates the Bode plot for given transfer functions.
- **Nyquist Plot (`nyquist_plot.ipynb`)** - Computes and visualizes the Nyquist stability criterion.
- **Step Response (`step_response.ipynb`)** - Simulates the step response of different systems.
- **Ramp Response (`ramp_response.ipynb`)** - Evaluates system behavior under ramp input.
- **System Stability (`stability_analysis.ipynb`)** - Calculates gain margin, phase margin, and overall stability assessment.
- **Transfer Function Analysis (`transfer_function.ipynb`)** - Implements various transfer functions and their properties.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Open a notebook in Google Colab by clicking the file in GitHub.
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. Modify parameters as needed to analyze different control systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- These notebooks require the `control` and `matplotlib` libraries. Install them if needed:
  ```python
  !pip install control matplotlib
  ```
- The plots and calculations provide insights into system dynamics and control design.

Feel free to modify these notebooks for further experimentation! ðŸŽ¯
