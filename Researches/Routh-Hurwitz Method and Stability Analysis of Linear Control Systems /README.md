# Routh-Hurwitz Method and Stability Analysis of Linear Control Systems 

The Routh-Hurwitz method is a fundamental tool in the stability analysis of linear control systems.
This method allows us to evaluate the stability of a system without explicitly calculating the roots of its
characteristic polynomial. Stability, in this context, means that all roots of the characteristic equation
lie in the left half of the complex plane, i.e., all roots have negative real parts.
