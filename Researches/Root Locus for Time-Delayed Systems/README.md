# Root Locus for Time-Delayed Systems

The Root Locus is one of the classical methods in control engineering used to study how
the locations of closed-loop poles vary with changes in a parameter (commonly the gain
ff K). When the system has a delay, analyzing its behavior using conventional methods
becomes somewhat more complicated. In the following, we will first explain the reason
for this complexity and then point out a few common approaches to address it.
