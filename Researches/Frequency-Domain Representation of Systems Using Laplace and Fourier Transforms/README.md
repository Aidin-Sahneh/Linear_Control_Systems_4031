#Frequency-Domain Representation of Systems Using Laplace and Fourier Transforms

The frequency-domain representation of systems using the Laplace Transform and Fourier Transform provides powerful tools for analyzing linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems. Letâ€™s explore the characteristics and advantages
of these representations compared to the time domain and discuss the key differences between Laplace and Fourier transforms with engineering intuition.
