# Python Codes - Linear Control Systems

This folder contains Python scripts related to **Linear Control Systems**. These scripts implement various control system concepts, including transfer functions, stability analysis, and response simulations.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Transfer Function Analysis (`transfer_function_analysis.py`)** - Defines and analyzes different transfer functions.
- **Bode Plot (`bode_plot.py`)** - Generates the Bode plot for control system evaluation.
- **Nyquist Plot (`nyquist_plot.py`)** - Visualizes system stability using the Nyquist criterion.
- **Step Response (`step_response.py`)** - Computes the step response of control systems.
- **Ramp Response (`ramp_response.py`)** - Evaluates system performance under ramp input.
- **Gain & Phase Margin (`gain_phase_margin.py`)** - Calculates gain margin and phase margin for stability assessment.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Run the scripts in Python.
2. Install required dependencies if needed:
   ```python
   pip install control matplotlib numpy
   ```
3. Modify the parameters to test different system behaviors.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- These scripts are useful for understanding control system behavior and designing controllers.
- Use Google Colab if you prefer an online execution environment.
