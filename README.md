# Linear_Control_Systems_4031

This repository contains all coursework, assignments, projects, and additional materials for the **Linear Control Systems** course. The course was taught by **Professor Hamidreza Taghirad** in [5, 2024].

## 📖 Course Overview
The **Linear Control Systems** course covers fundamental principles of control theory, including:
- Mathematical modeling of dynamic systems
- Transfer functions and block diagrams
- Stability analysis (Bode, Nyquist, and Root Locus)
- Controller design (PID, Lead-Lag, etc.)
- State-space representation and feedback control

## 📌 Course Activities
Throughout the semester, the following tasks were completed:
- 📂 **Assignments:** Weekly problem sets on system modeling, stability analysis, and controller design.
- 🚀 **Projects:** Practical applications of control theory using Python and MATLAB.
- 📊 **Simulations:** Bode plots, Nyquist diagrams, and root locus analysis.
- 📝 **Reports:** Documentation of findings and implementations.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Control Systems Library)
- **MATLAB/Simulink**
- **Google Colab** for interactive notebooks

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a structured archive for all work completed in this course. It can be a useful reference for future studies in control theory and practical implementations.
